# TipsOnTrack
Mobile iOS payment and mileage tracking application for delivery drivers.  

Developed because delivery drivers get paid differently then most other professions.  Delivery drivers are paid different hourly wages based on if their in the store or driving on the road.  They also get paid based on how many miles they drive but the majority of their income comes from the tips they get from customers.  With multiple ways to earn money, it's hard to estimate the average hourly, weekly, or monthly income earned.  This application helps solve the problem by letting the user calculate their daily income and input that value to see their income averages.  Implements graphs to help visualize monthly income averages, and Core Data for the ability to save input.

My very first iOS application developed for a friend and as a fun project.
